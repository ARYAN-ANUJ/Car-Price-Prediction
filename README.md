# Car Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting car prices based on various features of the car. The model is built using Python and the Scikit-learn library.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on various cars. The dataset used to train and test the model is the Car Features and MSRP dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about various car models such as make, model, year, engine type, horsepower


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn libraries

To install the required libraries, run the following command: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn


## Running the model

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project's directory and run the `main.py` file using Python.
3. The model will automatically train on the provided dataset and make a prediction for a sample house.


## Evaluation 
The Model is evaluated using R-squared and Mean absolute error .
